# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my various GNU/Linux machines both at home and at work. I use this repository for my comodity in order to quickly set up a new sistem in the event of a reinstall/distro hop. Feel free to read and use them for your own convenience!

# What do I use

The configurations are set for the programs that I use often:

	- i3 (window manager)
	- nano (text editor)
	- urxvt (terminal emulator)
	- Xfce terminal (terminal emulator)
	- bash

There are also scripts (in `~/.local/bin/`) with some useful tools, usually using dmenu, to interact with the system, to work with LaTeX, and for my i3 status bar.

This list of programs may change with time.

# How to use Git with your dotfiles

There is a very elegant way to keep track of your dotfiles in a Git repository. You can find it here: ( https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles ).
